#  Why Use the Akuity Agent Add-On? :thinking:
Argo CD is typically used for managing both cluster add-ons and developer applications, but there's no surefire way to hook Argo CD up to everything. In a world without Akuity, this experience can be very custom and cumbersome. With the Akuity Platform's unique agent architecture, we get to treat Argo CD as an add-on. Thus, other tooling like IaC or EKS add-on you can solve by bootstrapping ArgoCD into a cluster. For those who have a strong preference for AWS, the Akuity AWS add-on decomplexifies the process with tighter integration and security, and also saves users the time of applying yaml, using API/CLI, or using IaC.
